## Summary

The athlete talent identification and development platform is designed to support sports organizations by managing and analyzing a complete database of athletes. We designed and continue to maintain the full system, from database architecture and implementation of evaluation rules to the creation of advanced analytics modules. On top of this foundation, we develop state-of-the-art statistical tools and machine learning models that assess skills and potential, providing personalized recommendations to help athletes train the right way and become more competitive. Complementing the core platform, we built an app, available on both mobile and web, along with a dedicated **portal** that enables athletes, coaches, and organizations to plan and manage training schedules seamlessly. By combining systematic performance testing, intelligent analytics, and user-friendly digital tools, the platform delivers actionable insights for clubs, coaches, and athletes. Our clients include leading sports clubs, national athletes, and elite organizations that rely on the system to make data-driven decisions in athlete selection and training.
