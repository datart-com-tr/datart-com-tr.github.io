## Summary

The Aviation Tail Assignment System was developed to help airlines tackle one of their most critical planning challenges: assigning aircraft to flights at the tail-number level. By integrating operational and technical constraints such as maintenance schedules, ground times, routing restrictions, cabin configurations, and crew continuity, the system ensures optimal flight assignments that balance efficiency, profitability, and operational reliability.

We designed the mathematical optimization model, implemented advanced heuristics, and built a robust scheduling engine that reduces maintenance frequency, maximizes aircraft utilization, and increases passenger capacity. The system also improves coordination between departments such as maintenance, operations, and crew planning, ensuring smoother and more cost-effective workflows. Our solution integrates with real airline data, enabling adaptive and transparent planning. It delivers measurable improvements in profitability, resource utilization, and operational resilience.
