## Summary

The single runway dual overhead crane scheduling engine addresses the operational challenge of coordinating two cranes sharing the same runway without collisions or idle time. We designed a robust optimization model and developed a branch-and-price algorithm with heuristics to generate efficient schedules under real-world industrial constraints. The engine dynamically allocates tasks, accounts for safety buffers, and adapts to operational uncertainties.  

Beyond optimization, the project includes a simulation module that evaluates schedule feasibility in real time, ensuring robustness against disruptions. This solution provides factories and warehouses with a powerful decision support tool, significantly reducing task completion times and improving overall system throughput. By combining mathematical rigor with practical implementation, the project showcases how advanced optimization can solve complex, safety-critical scheduling problems in heavy industry.
