## Summary

This project develops an advanced decision support system to address one of the most pressing challenges in humanitarian logistics: managing inventories and supply flows in the aftermath of natural disasters. We designed a comprehensive **simulation model** that captures the dynamics of disrupted supply chains, fluctuating demand, infrastructure failures, and uncertain recovery timelines. On top of this simulation framework, we formulated and solved a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** model, enabling dynamic allocation and replenishment strategies that adapt as new information emerges in the disaster environment.  

The proposed system helps policymakers, NGOs, and emergency response agencies determine **where to preposition relief items, how to allocate scarce resources during the disaster, and how to adapt over time as conditions evolve**. By integrating **stochastic modeling, simulation, and MDP-based optimization**, the platform provides not only near-optimal solutions but also **robust, real-time decision guidance**.  

Beyond academic contributions, the societal impact is significant: the platform offers **actionable tools for agencies like AFAD in Turkey, the Red Crescent, and international humanitarian organizations**, enabling them to improve preparedness, accelerate response times, reduce shortages, and ultimately **save lives**. By transforming how relief logistics are planned and executed, this project directly supports more resilient communities in the face of future disasters.
