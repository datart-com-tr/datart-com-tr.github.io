## Refuel and Recharge Optimization

The refuel/recharge optimization engine is designed to support autonomous truck operations by identifying the most efficient strategies for energy replenishment. By integrating cost, time, and route considerations, it minimizes operational expenses, reduces downtime, and limits deviations from planned paths. The engine provides decision support that balances efficiency with reliability, ensuring that autonomous trucks can operate with greater continuity and lower overall costs.
