## Summary

The TV commercial scheduling optimization engine was developed to support broadcasters and advertising networks in maximizing both revenue and audience engagement. We designed the mathematical optimization model, implemented advanced heuristics, and built a scalable scheduling engine that accounts for advertiser requirements, contract obligations, audience ratings, and regulatory constraints. The system automatically generates schedules that minimize conflicts, ensure fair placement, and maximize target reach across different time slots.  

Our solution integrates seamlessly with real broadcast data, enabling rapid schedule adjustments in response to last-minute changes or live events. It delivers measurable improvements in efficiency, compliance, and revenue optimization, offering networks and advertisers a clear competitive edge. This project is a demonstration of how mathematical optimization and decision analytics can transform a highly complex, dynamic real-world scheduling challenge into a streamlined, automated process.
