## Summary

The refuel/recharge optimization engine is designed to support autonomous truck operations by identifying the most efficient energy replenishment strategies. Built from the ground up, we created and designed the mathematical optimization formulation, selected and tailored the algorithms, and implemented the full engine code in a top-down manner. By integrating cost, time, and route considerations, the engine minimizes operational expenses, reduces downtime, and limits deviations from planned paths. This comprehensive decision support system balances efficiency with reliability, enabling autonomous trucks to operate with greater continuity and lower overall costs.
