description: At Datart Lab, we design and build intelligent optimization engines from the ground up â€” starting with mathematical models and algorithms and extending all the way to robust software systems and user-friendly applications. We work with companies in logistics, transportation, healthcare, and beyond to turn complex challenges into practical, scalable solutions.  Alongside these industry collaborations, we also lead government-funded research projects and contribute to state-of-the-art academic work, ensuring our methods remain innovative, rigorously validated, and impactful.
